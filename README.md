Sample Terminal Output:

---------- Analyzing 180 Days of Data ----------
Current Date: June 29, 2022

Starting Weight: 250.0 lbs
Current Weight:  218.0 lbs
Goal Weight:     200.0 lbs

Way to go! You're 64.0% of the way to your goal!

Average Daily Calories Eaten (All of 2022): 2136.3
Average Daily Net Calories (All of 2022): 1498.2
Net Calories Below Goal (All of 2022): 324

Average Daily Calories Eaten (Past Week): 1808.4
Average Daily Net Calories (Past Week): 1058.3
Net Calories Below Goal (Past Week): 3092

Total Exercise Calories: 114853
This is equivalent to burning about 32.8 lbs of fat. Nicely done!

Total Calorie Deficit (Assuming 2350 Cal/Day Base Metabolism): 153324
Expected Weight Loss: About 43.8 lbs
Actual Weight Loss: 32.0 lbs
This implies a true base metabollic rate of about 2065 calories per day

So far you have been losing about 0.18 pounds per day (1.24 pounds per week).
If this trend holds, you will reach your goal weight in 101 days (on October 8).

Multi-Component Fit:
From day 0 to day 37, the loss rate is 0.404 lbs/day (2.82 lbs/week)
From day 37 to day 106, the loss rate is 0.146 lbs/day (1.02 lbs/week)
From day 106 onward, the loss rate is 0.062 lbs/day (0.44 lbs/week)

Based instead on an extrapolation of the multi-component fit described above,
you will reach your goal weight in 299 days (on April 24, 2023).

You're doing great! Keep up the good work! :)
